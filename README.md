# SwiftLearning

All my learning from my own challenge of 100 days of Code for iOS Dev

There are a few apps in here that can be ran by themselves. Anything with the postfix of **`Demo`** should be able to ran by itself.

All other code is part of a swift playground **`SwiftLearning.playground`**


All examples come from the book [SwiftUI Essentials - iOS 16 Edition](https://www.amazon.com/SwiftUI-Essentials-Learn-Develop-Using/dp/1951442512).
